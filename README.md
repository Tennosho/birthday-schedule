# Birthday Scheduler

<p>A problem a forgetful person like me often has is remembering the birthdays of my friends and family. This poses a problem as I am unable to plan surprises and gifts ahead of time. So, this script aims to address this issue by reminding me when the next birthday I need to prepare for is.</p>

## How it works
### Functions
<ol>
    <li>typing bday to the terminal should print the next birthday and who it is</li>
    <li>typing bday ls should list all the birthdays stored</li>
    <li>typing bday add and bday del should add and remove names/birthdays in the dictionary</li>
    <li>typing bday plan should open up some form of template for me to plan the next available birthday. It should have headings such as Gift Ideas, Log, Review, Reactions, etc. etc. for me to remember</li>
    <li>It should work every year</li>
</ol>

### Usage
Typing 'bday' without arguments will print the next birthday. \n
'bday ls' will list all the birthdays in random order. \n
Use 'bday add' and 'bday del' to modify the birthday list. \n

### Updates
<ul>
    <li>Completed functionaility for ls, add, delete commands</li>
</ul>

### Things to do
- Error handling
